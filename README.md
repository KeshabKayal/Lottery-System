# Decentralized Lottery System

## Project Description

The Decentralized Lottery System is a blockchain-based smart contract that runs a fair, transparent, and automated lottery. Users can enter the lottery by purchasing a ticket, and the contract will automatically and verifiably select a random winner to receive the entire prize pool.

## Project Vision

To provide a trustless and provably fair platform for a lottery or raffle, removing the need for a central operator and ensuring all participants have an equal and verifiable chance to win.

## Key Features

* **Ticket Purchase:** Users can enter the lottery by sending the required amount of `tCORE2` to the contract.
* **Automatic Prize Pool:** All entry fees are securely collected and held in the contract's prize pool.
* **Random Winner Selection:** A random winner is chosen from the list of participants after the lottery period ends.
* **Automatic Payout:** The entire prize pool is automatically and immediately transferred to the winner's wallet.
* **Transparent & Immutable Record:** All entries, the winner selection, and the final payout are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.

## Future Scope

* Implement a more secure, decentralized randomness source (e.g., Chainlink VRF) for winner selection.
* Build a frontend dashboard for users to easily buy tickets and see the current prize pool and past winners.
* Allow for multiple raffles to run simultaneously with different ticket prices or prizes.
* Integrate with stablecoins or other tokens for entry, not just the native coin.
* Add a timer or minimum participant count to automatically trigger the winner selection.
